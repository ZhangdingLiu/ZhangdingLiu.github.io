<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello! Iâ€™m **Zhangding Liu**, a Ph.D. student in Civil Engineering (Minor in Computer Science) and M.S. student in Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech. I am advised by Prof. John E. Taylor and Prof. Neda Mohammadi. My research interests lie at the intersection of **multimodal AI, disaster response, infrastructure resilience, and computational epidemiology**.

I have worked on projects involving **vision-language models**, **flood monitoring**, **COVID-19 modeling**, and **urban computing**, collaborating with institutes such as **Lawrence Berkeley National Lab** and local emergency services. I also interned at Chuangle Information Technology on smart construction systems.

Currently, I am actively exploring how to leverage large language models and multimodal data for real-time urban sensing and decision support under extreme events.

**Leveraging Vision-Language Models for Post-Disaster Road Inundation Detection**  
I developed a real-time flood depth and passability assessment framework using GPT-4V and few-shot visual prompting, integrated with satellite, street-level, and traffic data.
