Hello! Iâ€™m **Zhangding Liu**, a Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech working on **LLM**, **multimodal learning**, **digital twin**, and **urban intelligence**. I also hold an M.S. degree in **Computational Science and Engineering** from Georgia Tech.

My recent work spans **vision-language models**, **domain knowledge graph**, **disaster assessment**, and **disaster response**. I aim to build real-time, reliable, AI-driven systems that support critical decision-making under extreme conditions.


# ðŸš€ RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

## FloodVision: Urban Flood Depth Estimation Using Foundation Vision-Language Models and Domain Knowledge Graph

  <div><img src='images/floodvlm.png' alt="flood" width="100%"></div>
</div>
<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">

- Developed a spatial reasoning framework for flood depth estimation by integrating GPT-4o with a domain knowledge graph.
- Achieved 8.17â€¯cm error on real-world crowdsourced images, improving over prior methods by 20%.
- Supports real-time deployment for smart city flood monitoring and digital twins.

## MCANet: Multi-Label Damage Classification for Rapid Post-Hurricane Damage Assessment with UAV Images
<div class='paper-box'><div class='paper-box-image'>
  <div><img src='images/mcanet.png' alt="mcanet" width="100%"></div>
</div>
<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">

- Proposed MCANet, a Res2Net-based multi-scale framework with class-specific residual attention for post-hurricane damage classification.  
- Achieved 92.35% mAP on the RescueNet UAV dataset, outperforming ResNet, ViT, EfficientNet, and other baselines.
- Enables fast, interpretable multi-label assessment of co-occurring damage types to support emergency response and digital twin systems.

**Heat Resilience Mapping and Robotics in HVAC**  
- Developed a Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) map for Oakland, integrating data on weather, demographics, health, and green spaces. 
- Designed a web-based app in CityBES platform to visualize HVI data, enabling better urban heat resilience planning. 
- Explored robotics applications in HVAC systems to enhance quality, safety, and efficiency in installation and maintenance processes.

**UE4 + Transformer for Augmented Datasets**  
- Developed a context-aware synthetic image generation pipeline for construction machinery detection, integrating Swin Transformer into the PlaceNet framework to improve geometric consistency in object placement.
- Created the S-MOCS synthetic dataset with multi-angle foregrounds and context-aware object placement, achieving more robust detection of small and unusually oriented machinery, and outperforming real-world datasets by 2.1% mAP in object detection tasks.
