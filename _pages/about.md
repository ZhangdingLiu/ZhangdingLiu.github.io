Hello! Iâ€™m **Zhangding Liu**, a Ph.D. student in Civil Engineering (Minor in Computer Science) and M.S. student in Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech. My research interests lie at the intersection of **multimodal AI, disaster response, infrastructure resilience, and computational epidemiology**.

I have worked on projects involving **vision-language models**, **flood monitoring**, **COVID-19 modeling**, and **urban computing**, collaborating with institutes such as **Lawrence Berkeley National Lab** and local emergency services. 

Currently, I am actively exploring how to leverage large language models and multimodal data for real-time urban sensing and decision support under extreme events.

# ðŸš€ RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

## AI-enabled Coastal Community Flood Resilience

</div>
<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">

**Knowledge-Augmented Vision-Language Models for Flood Depth Inference**  
- Developed a real-time flood depth and passability assessment framework using GPT-4V and few-shot visual prompting, integrated with satellite, street-level, and traffic data.  
- Fine-tuned DistilBERT for post-hurricane Twitter analysis, identifying community needs and optimizing humanitarian aid allocation.  
- Integrated dynamic EMS vehicle staging with real-time road closure and flood impact data.
